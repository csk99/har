# Human Activity Recognition

#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
This project is about using Deep Learning algorithms in order to build an AI software to recognize day to day human activities or actions. We are using state of the art **Computer Vision** models like **InceptionV3** to extract key features from videos frames and trained a sequence model classifier to recognize a set of actions or activities choosen upfront.
We used this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4389.pdf) as an inspiration.

The purpose of this project is ________. (Describe the main goals of the project and potential civic impact. Limit to a short paragraph, 3-6 Sentences)

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
